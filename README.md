# Final Project for ITCS 3146  (Operating Systems and Networking) Term (First Summer 2021) 

1. Prepare 30 PowerPoint slides on the subject of Deadlocks (Chapter 6)

2. Find a youtube video (or another video) on the subject of Deadlocks. Save the video link in a text file.

3. Implement the Dining Philosophers problem (described on pages 167-170 in the textbook (chapter 2.5.1)). Create a Graphical User Interface - showing which philosopher is eating, and which is waiting/thinking at any given time. Show the forks. Use Java programming language for this project. 

Hint: A mutual exclusion structure would be necessary to handle the deadlock. For example a semaphore. Definition of semaphore is on p. 130, fig. 2-28 (chapter 2.3.5) which is implemented in C. When using Java - Java has a Semaphore class.
